# CS146: Computational Methods for Bayesian Statistics
## Problem Set 2
In this assignment for my CS146 class at Minerva University, I estimated the number of calls per minute at a call center for a given hour by finding the 98% confidence interval over the posterior distribution with a gamma prior. I used PyStan to accomplish this. 

I also used PyStan to calculate the posterior distribution of sample data with a normal likelihood and normal-inverse-gamma prior and the posterior distribution of normal likelihood log-transformed data with a normal-inverse-gamma prior. 

## Problem Set 3
In this assignment, I analyzed the effectiveness of a non-hierarchical model to show that it does not explain the control group data well for an experimental study.
